The Surveillance Bot Web Controller is a real-time web-based control system built using React that allows users to monitor and control a surveillance robot remotely.
The application communicates with the robot using WebSockets for low-latency command transmission and displays a live video feed from the bot’s camera.

This project demonstrates frontend–hardware integration, real-time communication, and responsive UI design for surveillance and monitoring applications.
